# computervision

Computer vision framework in C++ (possibly with Python bindings in the future). It comprises three main modules: Point cloud visualization, registration and semantics (object detection, tracking, etc.). Still in a very early stage of development!

## Dependencies:
- ANN 1.1.2 - Approximate Nearest Neighbor library (already included);
- Eigen 3.3.7 - Template library for linear algebra (header only library - just download it);
- Glad - GL Loader-Generator (provided);
- GLFW 3.3;
- OpenCV 4.0;
- OpenGL 4.6;
